I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statitstical Sciences at University College London, where I work with [Dr. Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) and I am a member of the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning group](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/). Prior to this, I was a PhD student at the [CDT in Mathematics and Statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/postgrad/centre-for-doctoral-training/) at the University of Warwick under the supervision of [Prof. Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/). My research broadly focuses on developing robust methodologies that cope with challenges stemming from different types of model misspecification. Some areas I am particularly interested in are robust generalisations of Bayesian inference and distributionally robust optimisation. 

My official name is spelled 'Charita,' but it is pronounced 'Harita,' so I go by the latter.
