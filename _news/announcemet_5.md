📌 I am co-organising this year's [UCL IMSS Annual Lecture on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://imss2026.github.io/), with Dr Lester Mackey as keynote speaker. This will be followed by the two-day [London Meeting on Computational Statistics](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/CSMLworkshop2026/) at the London Mathematical Society.
